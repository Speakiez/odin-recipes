    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This inside-out grilled cheese is a crispy, crunchy, cheesy masterpiece. 
        In my humble opinion, it is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich. 
        Make sure you follow some basic rules for this to work properly. 
        Only use airy, nutritionally insignificant white bread. 
        Be sure to use a nice sharp Cheddar and a quality nonstick pan over medium to medium-low heat.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>2 tablespoons butter, divided</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2 slices white bread</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Â½ cup shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</strong> 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Place bread slices over hot butter in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on 1 bread slice; place other bread slice, butter-side up, on top of cheese. Spread about 2 tablespoons cheese on top of sandwich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet next to sandwich. Flip sandwich onto melted butter, cheese-side down. Spread remaining cheese on top of sandwich. 
            Cook until cheese on the bottom is crispy and caramelized, <strong>3 to 4 minutes.</strong> 
            Flip sandwich and cook until cheese is crispy and caramelized on the other side, <strong>3 to 4 minutes more.</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
