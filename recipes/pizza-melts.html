    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        What do you get when a grilled cheese and a pepperoni pizza have a baby? A PIZZA MELT! 
        (Sorry for yelling, I’m excited.) I used to eat these as an after-school snack when I was growing up because they’re super easy and who doesn’t want pizza? 
        But now, decades later, I took this pizza-inspired sandwich to the next level by adding an herby-Parmesan butter to the bread which creates an extra crispy finish. 
        It’s to die for and way better than the pizza melts of my teen years. You’ve got to try it!
    </p>
    <p>
        Pizza melts are like a cross between your two favorite comfort foods: pizza and grilled cheese. They're fast, easy, and the perfect quick meal!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>1 Tbsp butter, room temperature</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1 Tbsp grated Parmesan</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2 slices hearty bread</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1/3 cup shredded mozzarella</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1 Tbsp pizza sauce</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>6 slices pepperoni</strong> 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir together the room temperature butter, grated parmesan, and Italian seasoning in a small bowl until evenly combined. Spread the Parmesan butter over one side of each slice of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip the bread over so the un-buttered side is facing up. Place half of the shredded mozzarella on one slice of bread. Next, add small dollops of the sauce over top of the cheese, followed by the sliced pepperoni. Finally, add the remaining cheese. Place the second slice of bread on top to close the sandwich, butter side facing out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the sandwich in a skillet and cook over medium-low heat until golden brown on each side and the cheese is melted on the inside. 
            <strong>Cut the sandwich in half and serve!</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
